## About
I'm a full-stack engineer. The boundary of a full-stack engineer's competancy not only ranges from frontend to backend technologies, but also extends to identifying the problem and delivering the final solution. A full-stack engineer needs to have deep domain knowledge, good sense of math and data, and solid engeering skills. And I've been practicing all these through my career.

## Work
### Airbnb (2014.04 ~ now)
I've been focusing on anti-fraud and China during my tenure at Airbnb
* Integration with Alipay Sesame Credit
  * Alipay Sesame Credit can verify a Chinese user's identify and creditworthiness. Airbnb uses it for its China users.
  * I came up with this integration idea, connected the resources, scoped the project, help solve contract and legal issues, and implemented the frontend UI and backend integration.
  * Outperformed the previous solution we used. The integration lifted bookings in China by double digits.
* Similar Photo Compare Engine
  * Fraudsters usually steal others' listing photos in order to create fake listings. So I created a photo compare engine to detect how a user uploaded photo is similar to other photos within this platform
  * Used perceptual hashing and discrete cosine transform
  * Compares with all ~100 million pictures uploaded to Airbnb
  * Serves ~100 compares per second
  * 99.99% uptime since launching
* Deep dive into China fraud industry
  * Systematically analyzed the fraud industry, including the organization, supply and monetization.
  * Successfully planted insiders so that I get first hand information in time.
  * Derived the profit margin formula of frausters and in return use the formula to evluate airbnb's anti-fraud metrics
* Misc engineering work
  * Main tech stack includes Java (Dropwizard), Ruby on Rails, Reachjs, Chef, python (data analysis)
* Connect resources between China and Airbnb
  * As one of the earliest Chinese engineers in Airbnb, I've been enthusiasticly connecting resources between China and Airbnb
  * Hosted executives from Alibaba, Ctrip, and etc
  * Created city based Wechat group for hosts in Beijing and Shanghai as a way for them to share hosting experiences and directly communicate with airbnb employees. This channel has identified several big bugs.
  * Most popular answerer on topics about Airbnb on Zhihu.com (Chinese Quora)

### Amazon Music (2013.01 ~ 2014.04)

## Amateur Work
### Glass Skim (https://github.com/shawiz/glass-skim)
* A Hackthon project that reads a picture of a large chunk of text and summarizes into a few sentences
* RESTful API. Users can use any device (e.g. iPhone and Google Glass) to take a photo of a page of a book or a paper, and upload to the server and get the summarized results
* Implemented a simplified version of TextRank algorithm for text summarization
* Won “the most creative awards” and “people’s choice” awards of PingWest Silicon Valley-Shanghai Hackathon

### Voyaguer (http://voyageurapp.com/)
